I'm Art Romera, a passionate student pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems, with a concentration in Information and Cybersecurity Management. As President of James Madison University's Lambda Phi Epsilon, I developed strong leadership skills by fostering community connections and organizing events that promoted Asian cultural awareness and philanthropy.

Through coursework such as Java Programming, Defensive Cybersecurity, and Computer Security Management, Iâ€™ve developed a solid foundation in information security, programming, and threat detection. I'm skilled at safeguarding organizational data and systems, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in various programming languages and cybersecurity frameworks while working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and improve continuously. I thrive on solving complex problems and am eager to apply my growing expertise in an organization.
## Objective

My journey in Computer Information Systems has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
